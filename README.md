## Introduction
Everything started during the python course for my MSC in Data Science and Big Data at DIt. Things were going well until the exam. Well, you know it goes wrong and we end up having to write an article on an advance subject in python. Well, why not right. Then the list of topics, we were all like :

And as the masochiste that I'm I took decorators. Why.? Good question. I invite you to read the rest of this article to discover what I discover and maybe learn a few new tricks.

PS i : You will have a lot of post scriptum in this article, be ready. Sorry for the so not conventional intro. Let's move on.

## Concept
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern as well as to the Open-Closed Principle, by allowing the functionality of a class to be extended without being modified. Decorator use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object's behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object. 

## Theory
The concept is really similar in python.
